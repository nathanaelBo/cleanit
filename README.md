# Notes
.env files and passwords should not be pushed to git. 
Since this is a demo application, they were committed anyway for a more convenient local deployment.

# Deployment
Simply start Docker Desktop and execute the command: ```docker compose up -d --build```
The frontend application can then be accessed via this link: http://localhost:3000
The backend swagger documentation can be accessed via this link: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
